            <p>Risk of Rain 2 is a rougelike FPS, where you pick from a collection of <a href="Survivors.html#bozo">Survivors</a> to try to escape the planet Petrical 5. You fall to the surface of the planet in a drop pod and fight monsters to earn XP and gold. Gold is used to open up chests that have fallen from the ship you came from. Inside these chesst are four diffrent types of items. Grey/white for common items, you gather these items in large quanties and work best when you have quite a few. Next are green or uncommon items, these can work great with only a few but the more the better. In unique orange crates are equipments. Equipments are like an extra ability with a long cooldown. Some heal you, others can trigger<strong> proc-chains</strong>, while others have more utilitarian uses. the last type of items found in chests are red or <em>Legendary</em> items. if you are lucky you might find one or two in a run, and can gaurantee a run if you get the right one. Finally there are blue or Lunar items which change the way you play for that run.</p>
